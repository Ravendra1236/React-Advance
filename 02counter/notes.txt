Lecture 5 : Hooks 
Why there is a need of hooks ? 
Because if we want to write our logic we can do it by using simple JS
but if we want to change UI then it will be control by react 
It gives its own functionality known as Hooks 
For different function implementations we have different hooks for UI updation .

// useState will return 2 value : value which has to be updated and function which will update that value
  let [value , setValue] = useState(0);

  const addValue = ()=>{
    // UI updation with help of hooks : useState 
    value = value + 1 ;
    setValue(value);
    // value = value + 1 ;
    console.log("Value added: " , value);
    
  }
  const deletedValue = ()=>{
    // UI updation with help of hooks : useState 
    value = value - 1 ;
    setValue(value);
    // value = value + 1 ;
    console.log("Value deleted: " , value);
    
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello! this is a counter button and value is = {value}</h1>
      <br />
      <button onClick={addValue}>Counter Up{value}</button>
      <br />
      <button onClick={deletedValue}>Counter Down{value}</button>
    </>
  )
